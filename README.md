# Project challenge:  Explorando IA Generativa em um Pipeline de ETL com Python!

## About

Repository containing the files developed in the project challenge proposed at **Santander Bootcamp 2023 - CiÃªncia de Dados com Python**.

## Proposal

For this challenge, I proposed exploring generative AI by creating personalized messages for an airline's passenger list based on some data about their flight.

## Repository Structure

-   **Data:**  It contains two **.csv** files, the first  'Airline Dataset Updated - v2.csv' with the data used for the project, and the second 'Airline Data Information.csv' with the final result of this.
-   **Python File:**  It contains the **etl_project.py** file developed for ETL.

## Metodology

- **E**xtract
	To extract the data, a CSV file was downloaded from an Airline dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/airline-dataset). This file contains thousands of synthetic data about an airline, but for this project I only used data from 3 passengers. For each passenger, the following data was obtained: their first name, their nationality, the name of the departure airport and the status of their flight.
- **T**ransform
	In the transformation step, using the OpenAI GPT-4 API, a personalized message was generated in the idiom of each passenger's nationality about their flight status information. The main information used to generate this message was the flight status of each passenger.
- **L**oad
	In this last step, a new CSV file was created adding the message generated by the API for each passenger.
	
## Conclusions

It was possible to conclude that the use of generative AI to create personalized messages for each passenger based on their nationality and flight information proved to be quite effective, with complete messages depending on the status of the flight. It is possible from this development to expand not only the number of passengers but also to further personalize the message by providing more data such as the passenger's age, gender, etc.
